    "A bingo card is a $5 \\times 5$ matrix of cells, where each column is labelled with one letter of the word *BINGO* and each cell hosts a number (see [Bingo cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(American_version)#Bingo_cards)).  The range of numbers that can appear on the card is normally restricted by column, starting with the 'B' column hosting values in the $1 \\dots 15$ range, the 'I' column hosting value in the $16 \\dots 30$ range and so on and so forth until the 'O' column hosting values in the $61 \\dots 75$ range (ranges are considered to be inclusive). Numbers cannot be repeated in a Bingo card. The central cell, i.e., the one in position `2,2` is a special free-cell, without a number, that is considered automatically filled.\n",
    "\n",
    "A winning Bingo card contains a line of five numbers that have all been called while conducting draws for a lottery. Winning lines can either be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. The central free-cell is automatically filled, and thus it is possible to win after only four numbers have been actually drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program taking into account the following tasks:\n",
    "1. Choose an appropriate data structure to represent a Bingo card in memory\n",
    "2. Write a function that creates a random Bingo card and stores it your data structure of choice\n",
    "3. Write a function that simulates a complete sequence of number draws\n",
    "   * A number must be drawn only once\n",
    "   * Only numbers between 1 and 75 are drawn\n",
    "4. Write a function that given a sequence of drawn numbers, checks whether a given Bingo card is a winning one\n",
    "5. Write a function that generate a Bingo card and a parameterised number `d` of potential draws, evaluating the minimum, maximum and average number of draws necessary to identify a winning configuration in the generated Bingo card."
